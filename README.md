# EMR Serverless Samples

This repository contains example code for getting started with EMR Serverless and using it with Apache Spark and Apache Hive.

In addition, it provides Container Images for both the Spark History Server and Tez UI in order to debug your jobs.

For full details about using EMR Serverless, please see the [EMR Serverless documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/emr-serverless.html).

## Pre-Requisites

_These demos assume you are using an Administrator-level role in your AWS account_

1. **Amazon EMR Serverless is now Generally Available!** Check out the console to [Get Started with EMR Serverless](https://console.aws.amazon.com/emr/home#/serverless).

2. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in region where you want to use EMR Serverless (we'll assume `us-east-1`).

```shell
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET-NAME --region us-east-1
```

3. Create an EMR Serverless execution role (replacing `BUCKET-NAME` with the one you created above)

This role provides both S3 access for specific buckets as well as read and write access to the Glue Data Catalog.

```shell
aws iam create-role --role-name emr-serverless-job-role --assume-role-policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "emr-serverless.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }'

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name emr-serverless-job-role --policy-name S3Access --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ReadFromOutputAndInputBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::noaa-gsod-pds",
                "arn:aws:s3:::noaa-gsod-pds/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET-NAME",
                "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET-NAME/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "WriteToOutputDataBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET-NAME/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}'

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name emr-serverless-job-role --policy-name GlueAccess --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "GlueCreateAndReadDataCatalog",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "glue:GetDatabase",
            "glue:GetDataBases",
            "glue:CreateTable",
            "glue:GetTable",
            "glue:GetTables",
            "glue:GetPartition",
            "glue:GetPartitions",
            "glue:CreatePartition",
            "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
            "glue:GetUserDefinedFunctions"
        ],
        "Resource": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### SDK Usage

You can call [EMR Serverless APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr-serverless/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) using standard AWS SDKs. The examples below show how to do this.

- [EMR Serverless boto3 example](/examples/python-api/README.md)
- [EMR Serverless Java SDK example](/examples/java-api/README.md)

## Utilities
